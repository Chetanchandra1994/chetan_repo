this and these words

In realms of thought where echoes ring,
This fleeting moment, a feathered wing.
These words, like whispers on the breeze,
A tapestry woven with graceful ease.

This journey through the vast unknown,
Where dreams and hopes have gently flown.
This world of ours, with skies so wide,
These words in hearts, forever reside.

This dance of time, a cosmic play,
These words entwined in night and day.
This silence deep, where meanings hide,
These words, the language of the tide.

In shadows cast by moonlit beams,
This canvas painted with vibrant dreams.
These words, like stars in midnight's sea,
A constellation of you and me.

This heartbeat shared, an ancient rhyme,
This rhythm flowing through the sands of time.
