In twilight's gentle, soft embrace,
A canvas painted, stars in space.
Whispers of the moonlight's song,
Nature's lullaby, all night long.

Beneath the willow's weeping boughs,
Dreams unfold, a tranquil drowse.
Dancing shadows, secrets keep,
Silent promises, as stars sweep.

Each line of verse, a fleeting kiss,
A poet's heart, in words, finds bliss.
